## What is CUDA?
CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface model created by NVIDIA. It allows you to use a CUDA-enabled graphics processing unit (GPU) for general-purpose processing. When you're developing on a CUDA file (usually with the .cu extension), you're essentially writing code that can run on the GPU, in addition to the CPU.
